    "# 🌌 Homework 4: Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due Date: Sunday, March 1, 11:59 PM\n",
    "You must submit this assignment to Pensieve by the on-time deadline, Sunday, March 1, 11:59 PM. Please read the syllabus for the Slip Day policy. No late submissions beyond what is outlined in the Slip Day policy will be accepted. **We strongly encourage you to submit your work to Pensieve several hours before the stated deadline.** This way, you will have ample time to reach out to staff for support if you encounter difficulties with submission. While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read the instructions carefully when submitting your work to Pensieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 👥 Collaboration Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you **write your solutions individually**. If you discuss the assignments with others, please **include their names** below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Grading\n",
    "As always, grading will be down into auto-graded answers and manually-graded (written) answers. Most of the plots will be manually graded. Your plots should be *similar* to the given examples. We will accept small variations, such as color differences or slight variations in scale. However, it is in your best interest to make the plots as similar as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** ALL plotting questions from here on out, we will expect **descriptive titles, axis labels, legends, etc**. The following question serves as a good guideline on what is \"enough\": *If I directly downloaded the plot and viewed it, would I be able to tell what was being visualized without knowing the question*\n",

    "## 🏎️ Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question in the assignment, please write down your answer in the answer cell(s) right below the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run code, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note: The local autograder tests will not be comprehensive. You can pass the automated tests in your notebook but still fail tests in the autograder.** Please be sure to check your results carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, unless we state otherwise, **do not use for loops or list comprehensions**. The majority of this assignment can be done using built-in commands in `pandas` and `NumPy`.  Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops / comprehensions, and you also won't be ready for the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging Guide\n",
    "If you run into any technical issues, we highly recommend checking out the [Data 100 Debugging Guide](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/). In this guide, you can find general questions about Jupyter notebooks / Datahub, Pensieve, and common `pandas` errors."

    "# Plotting and LLMs\n",
    "One of the biggest immediate impacts of large-language models (LLMs) on data science: **It's now a lot easier to write code to make plots.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before ChatGPT, code to produce plots could take a long time to write. You often had to spend a lot of time reading extensive documentation and searching online forums for responses from analysts who tried to plot something similar. \n",
    "- It could also take a lot of time to reshape and reformat the data to make it compatible with plotting functions. \n",
    "- This was one of the most time-consuming parts of Josh's and Ramesh's data science work before the release of ChatGPT!\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can often write the code corresponding exactly or almost exactly to your **plain language description of a plot**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In other words, we can now spend more on the \"what\" and \"why\" of our plots, as opposed to the \"how\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this change, the Data 100 visualization homework has evolved. Rather than provide you with a written description of many plots and have you write code to reproduce them, we have flipped the script: **We want you to spend more time thinking about what you want to plot and why you should plot it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- While you will still write some plotting code in this assignment, we think it's important to recognize that many standard plot creation tasks can now be carried out by AI, so long as you provide **specific and clear instructions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- But, as you will see while working on this assignment, identifying and describing a plot can be a challenging task. It's an essential skill of a good data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we want to recognize that not everyone enrolled in Data 100 feels comfortable using AI tools, and that is OK! **AI is not required for this assignment.** \n",
    "\n",
    "- However, throughout this assignment, we will include tips for how to use AI productively for plotting tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Please note that the [Data 100 LLM policy](https://ds100.org/sp26/syllabus/#collaboration-policy-and-academic-honesty) still applies in this assignment. **You cannot copy and paste anything from this assignment directly into an LLM.**"

    " \n",
    " - You have learned about the `sum` and `mean` functions for use in `.agg`. There is another `.agg` function called `nunique` that counts the number of unique elements.\n",
