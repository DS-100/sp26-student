    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run code, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

Does a particular score mean the same thing for two different restaurants? How might the public health department have decided on the inputs to the inspection score? Could there be bias in how scores are recorded? These kinds of questions may be helpful to think about as you define \"impact\".\n",

These tools will serve you well as a data scientist!"
